📊 Task-01: Population Data Visualization

📌 Objective

The objective of this task is to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable using appropriate charts such as a histogram and bar chart.
This task helps in understanding data distribution and basic exploratory data analysis.

📂 Dataset

Source: World Bank Open Data

Dataset Name: Population, Total

File Used: API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_34.csv

The dataset contains population data for different countries across multiple years.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas – for data handling

Matplotlib – for data visualization

📈 Visualizations Performed
1️⃣ Population Distribution (Histogram)

A histogram was created to visualize the distribution of population across countries for a selected year.

This helps in understanding how population values are spread and concentrated.

2️⃣ Top 10 Most Populous Countries (Bar Chart)

Aggregate regions and income groups were removed.

A bar chart was plotted to show the Top 10 most populous countries for the selected year.

This provides a clear comparison between countries.

🧹 Data Cleaning

Metadata rows were skipped while loading the dataset.

Aggregate entries such as regions and income groups were filtered out to focus only on individual countries.

✅ Outcome

Successfully visualized population distribution using a histogram.

Compared population of top 10 countries using a bar chart.

Gained hands-on experience with real-world data visualization.

📌 Conclusion

This task demonstrates basic data visualization skills using Python and real-world datasets.
It highlights the importance of data cleaning and choosing appropriate charts for analysis.
