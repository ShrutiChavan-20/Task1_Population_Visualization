# 📊 Task-01: Population Data Visualization

## 🎯 **Objective**
The objective of this task is to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable using appropriate charts such as a **histogram** and **bar chart**.  
This task helps in understanding data distribution and basic exploratory data analysis.

## 📂 **Dataset**
- **Source:** World Bank Open Data  
- **Dataset Name:** Population, Total  
- **File Used:** `API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_34.csv`

The dataset contains population data for different countries across multiple years.

## 🛠️ **Tools & Libraries Used**
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – for data handling
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization

## 📈 **Visualizations Performed**

### 🔹 **1. Population Distribution (Histogram)**
- A histogram was created to visualize the distribution of population across countries for a selected year.
- This helps in understanding how population values are spread and concentrated.

### 🔹 **2. Top 10 Most Populous Countries (Bar Chart)**
- Aggregate regions and income groups were removed.
- A bar chart was plotted to show the **Top 10 most populous countries** for the selected year.
- This provides a clear comparison between countries.

---

## 🧹 **Data Cleaning**
- Skipped metadata rows while loading the dataset.
- Removed aggregate entries such as regions and income groups to focus only on individual countries.
